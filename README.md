# NeuroCluster
## Improved IFCM for MR Image Segmentation

NeuroCluster is an advanced image segmentation toolkit leveraging the Improved Intuitionistic Fuzzy C-Means (IIFCM) algorithm, specifically tailored for magnetic resonance (MR) image analysis. This toolkit enables precise segmentation of MR images into distinct regions, enhancing the ability to identify and analyze various brain structures based on pixel intensity and color values.

## Installation Requirements

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system to run NeuroCluster. Additionally, the program depends on several Python packages for processing and visualizing images.

### Required Python Packages

- OpenCV (`cv2`): For image processing functionalities.
- NumPy (`numpy`): For efficient numerical computations.
- Matplotlib (`matplotlib`): For plotting and visualizing data.

### Installing Python Packages

The required Python packages can be easily installed using `pip`, the Python package manager. Execute the following commands in your terminal or command prompt to install them:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
